# fss

## Migration

**We have combined all the following crates into a single crate [fss-rs]**.
To fss-rs v0.4.0, there are no functional changes.
You only need to update import paths to migrate.

[fss-rs]: https://crates.io/crates/fss-rs

These legacy crates would be kept as is for compatibility, but no longer receive updates including security updates

## Benchmark

We use [Criterion.rs] for benchmarking.
Criterion.rs reports `criterion.tar.zst` are included in releases.

We use a (my) laptop as the benchmarking machine.
It is charged to 100% with the power plugged in when benchmarking.
Its CPU is [AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics], which is 8C16T.
We use [rayon] as the data-parallelism library, which establishes 16 threads when benchmarking with multithreading.
We ensure that its memory is enough for benchmarking, which is 16GB and has more than 5GB left when benchmarking.
Notice that we do not close all other programs as many as possible to reduce scheduling, though we do avoid doing any other thing at the same time.
