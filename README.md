Function secret sharing including distributed comparison & point functions

## Get started

First add the crate as a dependency:

```bash
# Run in your project directory
cargo add fss-rs
```

By default the embedded PRG and multi-threading are included.
You can disable the default feature to select by yourself.
**If you are on ARM machines**, see the [_Performance_](#performance) section for hardware acceleration.

Then construct a PRG implementing the corresponding `Prg` trait, and construct an impl `DcfImpl` or `DpfImpl` to use the PRG.
Check the doc comment for the meanings of the generic parameters.
If you want to set the **bit** length of the **domain** (input domain, instead of the range that is the output domain), check `new_with_filter` method.

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;

// Matyas-Meyer-Oseas (via AES128) provides 128-bit security and should be enough.
// Hirose (via AES256) still only provides 128-bit security because the output is not chained.
// But Hirose can be helpful is you are forced to choose AES256.
use fss_rs::dcf::prg::Aes128MatyasMeyerOseasPrg;
use fss_rs::dcf::{Dcf, DcfImpl};

let keys: [[u8; 32]; 2] = thread_rng().gen();
let prg = Aes128MatyasMeyerOseasPrg::<16, 2>::new(std::array::from_fn(|i| &keys[i]));
// DCF for example
let dcf = DcfImpl::<16, 16, _>::new(prg);
```

Finally, for key generation, construct the function to be shared together with 2 init keys, and call `gen`:

```rust
use fss_rs::dcf::{BoundState, CmpFn};
use fss_rs::group::byte::ByteGroup;
use fss_rs::group::Group;

let s0s: [[u8; 16]; 2] = thread_rng().gen();
let f = CmpFn {
  alpha: thread_rng().gen(),
  // `ByteGroup` for example
  beta: ByteGroup(thread_rng().gen()),
  bound: BoundState::LtBeta,
};
let keys = dcf.gen(&f, [&s0s[0], &s0s[1]]);
```

See the doc comment of the returned `Share` for how to split it into 2 shares.
The 2 shares are combined like this because they share many fields.

And for evaluation, construct the evaluated points, reverse the output buffer, and call `eval`:

```rust
let x: [u8; 16] = thread_rng().gen();
let mut y = ByteGroup::zero();
// The 2 parties use `true` / `false` to evaluate independently
dcf.eval(false, &k, &[&x], &mut [&mut y]);
```

For full domain evaluation, use `full_eval` instead.
While similar to `eval`, `full_eval` does not accept a vector of `x`, and instead expect a vector of `y` whose length is `2 ** (DOM_SZ * 8)` to store all evaluated `y`.

More examples are available as benchmarks in the [benches dir](./benches)

## Performance

The hot path of the project is PRG and xor operations.
We use [Rust std SIMD] for xor operations and the [aes crate of RustCrypto] for PRG.

[Rust std SIMD]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/index.html
[aes crate of RustCrypto]: https://crates.io/crates/aes

For PRG, enabling archtecture-specified CPU intrinsics can largely boost the performance.
The aes crate by default performs runtime detection of CPU intrinsics and uses them if available.

For x86/x86_64 (`i686`/`x86_64` in targets), AES-NI is used if available, which works out-of-the-box.

For ARMv8 (`aarch64` in targets), while ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions is supported, to use it,
in addition to the above, you need to set some flags to enable it.
See the [doc of the aes crate] for details
We also quote the section here:

> is available when using Rust 1.61 or above, and can be enabled using the
> `aes_armv8` configuration flag.

> On Linux and macOS, when the `aes_armv8` flag is enabled support for AES
> intrinsics is autodetected at runtime. On other platforms the `aes`
> target feature must be enabled via RUSTFLAGS.

## Benchmark

We use [Criterion.rs] for benchmarking.
Criterion.rs reports `criterion.tar.zst` are included in releases.

We use a (my) laptop as the benchmarking machine.
It is charged to 100% with the power plugged in when benchmarking.
Its CPU is [AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics], which is 8C16T.
We use [rayon] as the data-parallelism library, which establishes 16 threads when benchmarking with multithreading.
We ensure that its memory is enough for benchmarking, which is 16GB and has more than 5GB left when benchmarking.
Notice that we do not close all other programs as many as possible to reduce scheduling, though we do avoid doing any other thing at the same time.

## Deprecation

`crate::dcf::prg::Aes256HirosePrg` (enabled by default by the `prg` feature, and only this one) has wrong implementation.
It is fixed in version 0.4.3 of crate fss-rs, versions 0.5.2 and 0.6.3 of crate dcf, and version 0.5.2 of crate dpf-fss (since it depends on dcf).
