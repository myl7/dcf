## [0.5.0]

- v0.5 adds a new generic parameter `OUT_BLEN_N` to `Prg`.
Please set it to the literal `1` for DPFs and `2` for DCFs.
- `Prg` implementations are moved from `crate::dcf/dpf::prg` to `crate::prg`.
Now DPFs and DCFs share some same PRG implementations.

## [0.4.3]

`crate::dcf::prg::Aes256HirosePrg` (enabled by default by the `prg` feature) has wrong implementation.
It is fixed at v0.4.3 of the crate fss-rs, v0.5.2 and v0.6.3 of the crate dcf, and v0.5.2 of the crate dpf-fss (since it depends on the crate dcf).
Other similar PRGs, e.g., `crate::dpf::prg::Aes256HirosePrg`, are not affected.
